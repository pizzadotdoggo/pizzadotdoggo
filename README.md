  <summary>☆Important!!☆</summary> 

  ★ I may not respond, but I will INT! Sometimes I prefer not to type!

  ★ I am neurodivergent and sometimes don't understand social cues or just stuff in general, please be patient with me! Also due to this tone tags are apreciated!

 ★ I am a **minor** do **not** under **any** circumstances be weird towards me **please**

★ DNC in my ponies names mean 'do not copy' so please don't, I work very hard on them ^^

★ I am Demiplatonic, Therefore it is more than likely that it will take me a while to warm up to people!!

★ Apothisexual, **Anything** remotely sexual can and will make me uncomfortable and I might even block said person who is acting that way, it is best not to even make flirty jokes towards me anyways unless I am close to you, and said **In a platonic manner**
